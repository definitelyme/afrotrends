According to Bernstein, who was on her way to her brother’s place, she stopped her vehicle at the intersection of West Gorham Street and State Street at about 1a.m when she was approached by four white men, one of whom yelled a racial epithet. She said she was waiting at a stoplight in downtown Madison, Wisconsin, and suffered second- and third-degree burns after the men used a spray bottle to douse her with lighter fluid before throwing a lighter at her.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-preformatted\"><iframe src=\"https://abcnews.go.com/video/embed?id=71470353\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\" scrolling=\"no\" style=\"border:none;\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe></pre>\n\n\n\n<p>“I was listening to some music at a stoplight and then all of a sudden I heard someone yell the N-word really loud and I turned my head to look and somebody’s throwing lighter fluid on me. And then they threw a lighter at me, and my neck caught on fire and I tried to put it out, but I brushed it up onto my face”, she told Madison Police. Following the attack, Bernstein put out the fire and drove home, and was later treated at a nearby hospital. Bernstein described the men as “classic Wisconsin frat boys” who appeared to be intoxicated.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large is-resized\"><img src=\"https://afrotrends.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Lastone-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-5084\" width=\"777\" height=\"518\" srcset=\"https://afrotrends.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Lastone-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://afrotrends.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Lastone-300x200.jpg 300w, https://afrotrends.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Lastone-768x512.jpg 768w, https://afrotrends.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Lastone.jpg 1200w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 777px) 100vw, 777px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-preformatted\"><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">A Black woman named Althea Bernstein was set on fire by white men in downtown Madison, and the news has basically ignored it in favor of talk of statues and damaged businesses.<a href=\"https://t.co/rzy5JRIxkX\">https://t.co/rzy5JRIxkX</a></p>— Chet Agni (@ChetAgni) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ChetAgni/status/1276161442614595590?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">June 25, 2020</a></blockquote> <script async=\"\" src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script></pre>\n\n\n\n<p>The president of the Boys and Girls Clubs of Dane County, Michael Johnson, <a href=\"https://www.houstonchronicle.com/news/article/Assault-near-Wisconsin-protests-investigated-as-15366309.php\" class=\"rank-math-link\">released a statement</a> on behalf of Bernstein’s family stating that they were “saddened at what happened to Althea and the unprovoked attack on her body.

        "rendered": "\n<p>Kanye West has announced plans to bring his Yeezy brand to Gap. The rap superstar is set to design adult and kids’ clothing that will be sold at the chain’s stores next year. The struggling mall brand plans to introduce Yeezy Gap in stores and online in the first half of 2021.The Gap brand, which has flailed in recent years as it struggled with an identity crisis, believes to revive its fortunes with Kanye West. The retailer is teaming up with Mr. West and Yeezy, his fashion company, for a new clothing line called Yeezy Gap.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-preformatted\"><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/FsEm6t9i4h0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen=\"\" width=\"853\" height=\"480\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe></pre>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeezy’s design studio, under Mr. West’s creative direction, plans to create “modern, elevated basics for men, women and kids at accessible price points.” Mr. West’s “design vision” will extend to how the line will be showcased in Gap’s stores and online.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&nbsp;The San Francisco-based Gap Inc., is making a far bigger bet on Yeezy and Mr. West, a celebrity, creative entrepreneur, rapper and designer, than a typical designer collaboration. They agreed to a 10-year deal starting this month, with the option to renew after five years. At the five-year point, Gap is hoping that Yeezy Gap will be generating $1 billion in annual sales. For context, Gap’s brand brought in $4.6 billion in global revenue last year. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large is-resized\"><img src=\"https://afrotrends.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/KanyeDaughter-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-4914\" width=\"762\" height=\"508\" srcset=\"https://afrotrends.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/KanyeDaughter-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://afrotrends.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/KanyeDaughter-300x200.jpg 300w, https://afrotrends.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/KanyeDaughter-768x512.jpg 768w, https://afrotrends.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/KanyeDaughter-1536x1025.jpg 1536w, https://afrotrends.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/KanyeDaughter.jpg 2048w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 762px) 100vw, 762px\" /><figcaption>Kanye West and his daughter, North, at the Yeezy show in Paris in February.</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Gap did not respond to a request for comment on the terms of the deal.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Gap Inc., which also owns Old Navy and Banana Republic, is aiming to refocus its namesake brand, which has seen sales plummet in the past few years, closed more than 100 North American stores and struggled to define its place within the apparel industry. It, like other retailers, has also been badly hit by the coronavirus pandemic.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Kanye West’s Yeezy is best known for pricey sneakers that sell out online quickly but Yeezy footwear, made with sneaker company Adidas, won’t be sold at Gap stores. For Yeezy, being in more than 1,100 stores worldwide could get the brand in front of more people.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Earlier today, West took to his <a href=\"https://twitter.com/kanyewest/status/1276462079625445382\" class=\"rank-math-link\">twitter</a> account with a photo of what the collaboration might look like: bright colored hoodies, jackets and T-shirts. West has a history with Gap. He worked at one of its stores in Chicago as a teenager. As part of the deal announced Friday, Yeezy will receive royalties and possibly Gap stock if the line sells well.Shares of the retailer jumped 16% in premarket trading. </p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-preformatted\"><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"en\">YEEZY AND GAP FORM PARTNERSHIP <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/WESTDAYEVER?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#WESTDAYEVER</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/NyxgfYTjJM\">pic.twitter.com/NyxgfYTjJM</a></p>— ye (@kanyewest) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/kanyewest/status/1276495666781528066?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">June 26, 2020</a></blockquote> <script async=\"\" src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script></pre>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-preformatted\"><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"und\"><a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/WESTDAYEVER?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#WESTDAYEVER</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/ASMwbx7T2o\">pic.twitter.com/ASMwbx7T2o</a></p>— ye (@kanyewest) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/kanyewest/status/1276462079625445382?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">June 26, 2020</a></blockquote> <script async=\"\" src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script></pre>\n\n\n\n<p>Black Excellence and value for partnership, what&#8217;s your take?</p>\n",
