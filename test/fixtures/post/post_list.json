However,  in 2020, faced with the economic uncertainty that came with the Pandemic and as police brutality continues to devastate black families, Juneteenth this year is a day to let your voice be heard. For many Americans who are not part of the black community, recent <a href=\"https://afrotrends.com/minneapolis-protest-over-the-sad-death-of-george-floyd-has-reached-new-york-denver-and-detroit/\" class=\"rank-math-link\">protests over police brutality</a> have driven awareness on the importance of Juneteenth.  </p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><img src=\"https://afrotrends.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/1000-2-3.jpeg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-4571\" srcset=\"https://afrotrends.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/1000-2-3.jpeg 1000w, https://afrotrends.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/1000-2-3-300x200.jpeg 300w, https://afrotrends.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/1000-2-3-768x511.jpeg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Juneteenth celebrations this year will be marked with marches and demonstrations, not forgetting our ever vibrant expressions of black joy; in spite of an especially traumatic time for the nation. Just like the nationwide protests that followed the recent deaths of black men and women, the Juneteenth celebrations are likely to be more multiracial.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><img src=\"https://afrotrends.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/1000-1-3.jpeg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-4573\" srcset=\"https://afrotrends.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/1000-1-3.jpeg 1000w, https://afrotrends.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/1000-1-3-300x194.jpeg 300w, https://afrotrends.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/1000-1-3-768x497.jpeg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;This is one of the first times since the ’60s, where the global demand, the intergenerational demand, the multiracial demand is for systemic change.&#8221; Noliwe Rooks &#8211; A Cornell University professor, continued; &#8220;there is some understanding and acknowledgment at this point that there’s something in the DNA of the country that has to be undone.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><img src=\"https://afrotrends.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/1000-3-2.jpeg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-4569\" srcset=\"https://afrotrends.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/1000-3-2.jpeg 1000w, https://afrotrends.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/1000-3-2-300x200.jpeg 300w, https://afrotrends.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/1000-3-2-768x511.jpeg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" /><figcaption> Statue depicts a man holding the state law that made Juneteenth a state holiday in Galveston, Texas. The inscription on the statue reads &#8220;On June 19, 1865, at the close of the Civil War, U.S. Army General Gordon Granger issued an order in Galveston stating that the 1863 Emancipation Proclamation was in effect. That event, later known as &#8220;Juneteenth,&#8221; marked the end of slavery in Texas. Celebrated as a day of freedom since then, Juneteenth grew into an international commemoration and in 1979 became an official Texas holiday through the efforts of State Representative Albert (AL) Edwards of Houston.&#8221;</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>A holiday in some major cities in America, it is a time of reflection. It&#8217;s a time for the  Black community to take pride in what they and their ancestors have overcome. &#8220;So Juneteenth is a celebratory event but we’re not celebrating the country. We’re celebrating our own freedom and our own ability to be liberated and the resiliency of black people&#8221;; Black Voters Matter co-founder LaTosha Brown says. Brown believes this is shaping up to be a politically defining moment ahead of the November elections. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>We are not there yet, but we&#8217;ll keep fighting. Today was a day of joy and pain; now its a day for national action. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Will you take action? </p>\n",

He was convicted of two counts charges of theft, burglary and felony murder after a police officer shot and killed his friend, A&#8217;Donte Washington, 16, in 2015 under the state’s accomplice liability law.&nbsp;Under Alabama’s accomplice liability law, Smith was found guilty of murder because Washington died while they were accomplices committing a crime, even though he did not directly cause the death. He admits to breaking into two homes with four friends when police caught them. In the body camera footage, it can be seen that one of Smith’s accomplices, 16-year old A’Donte Washington, fired shots at the police; an officer, who was not publicly identified, fatally shot back and killed Washington almost instantly. The officer was cleared from any wrongdoing as the grand jury ruled that the shooting was justified. </p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-large is-resized\"><img src=\"https://afrotrends.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Lakeith.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-4559\" width=\"701\" height=\"394\" srcset=\"https://afrotrends.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Lakeith.jpg 800w, https://afrotrends.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Lakeith-300x169.jpg 300w, https://afrotrends.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Lakeith-768x432.jpg 768w, https://afrotrends.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Lakeith-600x337.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 701px) 100vw, 701px\" /><figcaption>Smith in court during his trial.</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Despite being a minor when the shooting happened, Smith was tried as an adult. He was originally sentenced to 65 years in prison; 30 years for felony murder, 15 years for burglary, and 10 years for theft. His sentence was reduced to 55 years a year later because of a sentencing technicality when a judge ruled that his 10-year sentence could run concurrently with the 15-year sentence. The law states a person is legally liable for the behavior of another who commits a criminal offense if that person aids or abets the first person in committing the offense. Alabama is one of 46 states that have a similar version of this law.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The other defendants &#8211; Montgomery residents Jadarien Hardy, 22; Jhavarske Jackson, 23; and La’Anthony Washington, 22; accepted plea agreements for the charges but Smith declined a plea agreement that would have reduced his sentence to 25 years.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.thepetitionsite.com/551/873/352/justice-for-lakeith-smith/\">Another petition</a> that was initially created after Smith&#8217;s sentencing is regaining momentum with 60,000 signatures. Also, an Instagram post made in 2018 by theshaderoom, an account with about 20 million followers, is now resurfacing. As of Wednesday afternoon, it had about 95,000 reactions. </p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-preformatted\"><div class=\"fb-post\" data-href=\"https://web.facebook.com/brontina.smith/posts/2886317338090852\" data-show-text=\"true\" data-width=\"\"><blockquote cite=\"https://developers.facebook.com/brontina.smith/posts/2886317338090852\" class=\"fb-xfbml-parse-ignore\"><p>I LOOOVE IT💪🏽💪🏽💪🏽</p>Posted by <a href=\"#\" role=\"button\">Brontina Smith</a> on&nbsp;<a href=\"https://developers.facebook.com/brontina.smith/posts/2886317338090852\">Wednesday, June 3, 2020</a></blockquote></div></pre>\n",

A former slave portrayed the character at the 1893 World’s Fair in Chicago, and a white actress known for performing in blackface played Aunt Jemima on a radio series in the 1930s.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><img src=\"https://afrotrends.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/SlaveJEMIMA.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-4547\" srcset=\"https://afrotrends.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/SlaveJEMIMA.jpg 728w, https://afrotrends.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/SlaveJEMIMA-300x220.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 728px) 100vw, 728px\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>“While work has been done over the years to update the brand in a manner intended to be appropriate and respectful, we realize those changes are not enough,” said Kristin Kroepfl, Quaker’s chief marketing officer, in a statement.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><img src=\"https://afrotrends.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Pancakes-1024x576.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-4548\" srcset=\"https://afrotrends.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Pancakes-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://afrotrends.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Pancakes-300x169.jpg 300w, https://afrotrends.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Pancakes-768x432.jpg 768w, https://afrotrends.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Pancakes-600x337.jpg 600w, https://afrotrends.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Pancakes.jpg 1200w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>PepsiCo bought Quaker Oats in 2001, inheriting the Aunt Jemima brand.
