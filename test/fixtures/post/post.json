    "rendered": "\n<p>A Tallahassee man, Aaron Glee Jr. has openly confessed that he kidnapped and killed both Oluwatoyin Salau and Victoria Sims in grisly crimes that have horrified the community. </p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-large is-resized\"><img src=\"https://afrotrends.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Aaron-16.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-4693\" width=\"673\" height=\"897\" srcset=\"https://afrotrends.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Aaron-16.jpg 300w, https://afrotrends.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Aaron-16-225x300.jpg 225w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 673px) 100vw, 673px\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>According to newly released court documents, Aaron Glee waived his right to remain silent and gave full account of how he kidnapped and killed both Oluwatoyin Salau, a 19-year-old student and protester, and Victoria Sims, a 75-year-old volunteer and retired state worker, to Tallahassee Police Department and the Orlando Police Department. He said kept Salau a prisoner in his run-down home on Monday Road for several days, raping her and eventually deciding to kill her to avoid getting caught.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While at the hospital, Glee had made voluntary admissions to officers guarding him that he had murdered two women in Tallahassee; he also placed a telephone call to his mother and made these same admissions. The documents also reveal that Salau and Sims apparently met one another in the last days of their lives, after Glee arranged for Sims to pick both him and Salau up at a bus stop.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Salau went missing June 6, followed by Sims on June 11. On June 13, numerous TPD officers descended on his home after tracing Sims&#8217; cellphone to the address. They found Sims’ body under a bloody sheet in a bedroom and Salau’s body under a pile of leaves in the woods behind the house. By that time, Glee had already bought a one-way ticket to West Palm Beach, where he has family members. Orlando police, working off information from TPD, intercepted him at a Greyhound bus station and took him into custody.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He complained of breathing problems and was taken to an Orlando hospital, where he openly chatted about the two murders, according to the arrest report.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Glee has been charged with two counts of kidnapping and murder and one count of sexual assault, police said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The two women met after recent Black Lives Matter protests seeking justice after the death of George Floyd, who died May 25 while in police custody in Minneapolis, Minn. Salau had even spoken at the rallies, reports said. Glee told investigators he struck up a conversation with Salau on June, 6 at a bus stop on Apalachee Parkway. She told him she had been sexually assaulted earlier in the day, something she revealed publicly on Twitter.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He offered to take her to his house to bathe and sleep. He said he called Sims, who picked them both up in her white Toyota sedan. Glee told investigators that after arriving at his house, Salau took a shower. He tried to have sex with her but she said no and tried to fight him off.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;He stated that she physically resisted him, and that she bit him upon his right forearm during the struggle,&#8221; the report says. But Glee overpowered her. &#8220;He was asked if he would characterize his actions as rape,&#8221; the report says. &#8220;Glee responded in the affirmative.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Glee said he kept Salau tied up and imprisoned in his home for three to five days but wasn&#8217;t sure how long because &#8220;he was heavily under the influence of alcohol.&#8221; He said he released her at times to eat and bathe. He admitted &#8220;sexually assaulting her numerous times during those three to five days.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Glee, who has a prison record dating back decades, worried that if he were to let her go, he’d land behind bars again, said he was aware that he would be arrested and likely sentenced to prison if he allowed (Salau) to leave the residence,&#8221; the arrest report says. &#8220;Glee indicated that he determined that his only course of action was to end her life.&#8221; He bound her with rope in a manner he thought would cause her to die and left her in a bedroom.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Glee explained how over the course of several hours he would re-enter the bedroom multiple times to see if (Salau) was still alive,&#8221; the report says. “Ultimately, he entered into the bedroom and determined (she) was deceased.” Police reports say Sims also was bound. Investigators believe Glee ransacked her apartment on BlairStone Road, stole her car and kidnapped her. Her car was found stuck in mud outside his house.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Glee was arrested in Orlando but brought to Tallahassee, where he’s facing two counts each of murder and kidnapping and one count of sexual assault. He had his first court appearance on the new charges Saturday via video conference.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Chief Circuit Judge Jonathan Sjostrom ordered Glee held without bail at the request of Assistant State Attorney Callaway Scott, who called him a “danger to society.”</p>\n",
